\item{updateID}{Character string that will become the `updateID` column for this table. For example, "survey11Add" for Survey 11.}

This function returns a list, not a data frame. The list contains the CENSUS_COUNTY_DEMO and CITIES portions of the database. This modifies CITIES from the makeDemoGeo function and returns the finished version of CITIES.
